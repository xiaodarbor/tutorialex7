//*resonance response*//

//idea
using emission of sounds of a specific frequency compatible with the resonant frequency of an object to remotely control it

- start with a grid with spheres placed on each grid square
- spheres are of known resonant frequency
- ability to remotely cause each sphere to crack/shatter by emitting a frequency compatible with the object
- ability to move spheres in a certain direction through a directed pulses of sound compatible with the object

//input and sensors

- frequency sensors
- frequency emmitter 

//output and physical parts

- grid board (preliminary)  
- spheres with known material and resonant frequency/break point
- shaped and directed frequency emitter (perhaps in a globular form) 

//bits to atoms

- sound emitter's direction, frequency, intensity can be programmed
- programmable materials with properties related to their resonant frequency/the way they break/ respond to sound can be explored
- computer interacts with materials physically through sound (compressed air) 

//applications

- sound can travel through any medium but a vacuum, even through liquids and better through solids
- allow for remote detonation/moving of objects through mediums
